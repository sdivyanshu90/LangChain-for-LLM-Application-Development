# 🌟 LangChain for LLM Application Development  

Welcome to the official notebook repository for the course **LangChain for LLM Application Development**, brought to you by **DeepLearning.AI** in collaboration with **LangChain**.  

This repo is designed to help you **learn by doing** — follow along with the course, experiment with the code, and start building your own applications powered by large language models (LLMs). 🚀  

---

## 📘 What You’ll Learn  

By working through these notebooks, you’ll:  
- Explore the **core building blocks** of LangChain.  
- Design **prompt chains** that guide LLM reasoning.  
- Use **memory** to give applications context and persistence.  
- Build **agents** that can decide which tools to use.  
- Connect LLMs to **external data and APIs**.  
- Deploy and refine your own **LLM-powered apps**.  

This course is hands-on, so expect to write, run, and experiment with code throughout.

## ⚙️ Getting Started  

1. **Clone the repository**  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sdivyanshu90/LangChain-for-LLM-Application-Development.git
cd LangChain-for-LLM-Application-Development
````

2. **Set your API key**

Most notebooks require access to an LLM provider (such as OpenAI, Gemini, etc).
Set your API key as an environment variable, and before committing and pushing the repo, make sure not to push the API key to GitHub:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

(Windows PowerShell)

```powershell
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"
```

## ▶️ Using the Notebooks

Start Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then open the notebook that matches the lesson you’re currently taking in the course. Each notebook is structured to help you follow along step by step.
